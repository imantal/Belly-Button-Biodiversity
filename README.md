# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
https://imantal.github.io/Belly-Button-Biodiversity/
## Project Overview
For this project, a dashboard is developed to visualize the bacterial data obtained by sampling the naval of a few hundred volunteers to identify the bacteria species colonizing in their belly button. The dashboard has a drop-down menu to select the volunteer id, a panel that shows the demographic information for the selected volunteer, a bar chart showing top 10 bacterial species found in the volunteer’s belly button, a bubble chart showing all the bacteria species found in the volunteer’s belly button and a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value. JavaScript is used to retrieve, manipulate, and parse the bacterial data contained in a JSON file. Plotly, a JavaScript data visualization library, is used to create the aforementioned interactive plots. HTML features and Bootstrap are used to customize the webpage.
